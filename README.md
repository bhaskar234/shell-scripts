Shell Scripts
-------------

1. **respawn_django.sh:** One of my django projects crashes whenever a python file is saved.
So, I need to restart my server whenever a file is saved. So, if I start the server using
 this script, it will automatically restart whenever the server stops. To stop the server,
  we can simply use CTRL+C.
